# MechARMical-Robotic-Hand

## Overview

Built off the open-source project - Robot Nanohand - and augmented to translate input from EMG sensors. 

**Build specs:**

The MechARMical Robotic Hand features:

* **Articulated movement** with FeeTech servo motors
* **Individual finger articulation** with non-linear motion
* **Teleoperation** via EMG muscle sensors

## Build Process

### Hardware

1. Manufacturing of individual parts
2. Assembly

### Software

3. Servo software development
4. Integration of EMG muscle senors

### Quick Reference

* **Bill of Materials**: Complete component list with suppliers
* **Nanohand Open-Source**: Available in `/3D/` directory (OnShape CAD)
* **Software Control**: Software Repository using FeeTech

## Project Status

**In Progress** - This project is being developed for a university course.
